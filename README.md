# BrainConnectToolbox

This toolbox applies advanced diffusion tractography proceedures in order to define connectivity profiles between distal brain regions. The most basic requirements are some diffusion imaging data suitable for HARDI tractography (ideally 45+ directions at b=2000+) and a parcellation image in the same space defining anatomical landmarks of interest (e.g. seed and target regions).
