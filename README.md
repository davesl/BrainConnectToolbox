# BrainConnectToolbox

This toolbox applies advanced diffusion tractography proceedures in order to define connectivity profiles between distal brain regions. The most basic requirements are some diffusion imaging data suitable for HARDI tractography (ideally 45+ directions at b=2000+) and a parcellation image in the same space defining anatomical landmarks of interest (e.g. seed and target regions). 

To get started see RunParcellation.m

Note: The toolbox should be run from a Unix/Linux based machine with MRTrix3 installed in the enironment variable path. A standalone version has been included, just add the /bin and /scripts directories to your ./bashrc path setups.
